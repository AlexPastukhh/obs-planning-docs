  "description": "Check/traverse current validation/consistency work required by the current composition.",
  "meaning": "Require the named Validation capability to receive a real applicability/traversal check in the current normal IDTSPE Shell pass. The command expresses an explicit semantic requirement; current Shell topology resolves it to the canonical port. A positive semantic result is not required.",
  "activeContextBehavior": "Compose into the current/next normal IDTSPE Shell pass. If equivalent Validation work already exists for the same subject/basis/operation, reuse it instead of repeating it.",
  "traversalReadMode": "Read the included command route and canonical owner files proportionally. Reuse current trustworthy owner/process context; reread only stale, uncertain or newly material owners.",
