  "description": "Check/traverse handoff/methodology-direction work required by the current composition.",
  "meaning": "Require the named Handoff capability to receive a real applicability/traversal check in the current normal IDTSPE Shell pass. The command expresses an explicit semantic requirement; current Shell topology resolves it to the canonical port. A positive semantic result is not required.",
  "activeContextBehavior": "Compose into the current/next normal IDTSPE Shell pass. If equivalent Handoff work already exists for the same subject/basis/operation, reuse it instead of repeating it.",
