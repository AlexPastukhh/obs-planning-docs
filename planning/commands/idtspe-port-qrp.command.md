  "description": "Check/traverse material Question/Risk/Problem lifecycle work required by the current composition.",
  "meaning": "Require the named Q/R/P capability to receive a real applicability/traversal check in the current normal IDTSPE Shell pass. The command expresses an explicit semantic requirement; current Shell topology resolves it to the canonical port. A positive semantic result is not required.",
  "activeContextBehavior": "Compose into the current/next normal IDTSPE Shell pass. If equivalent Q/R/P work already exists for the same subject/basis/operation, reuse it instead of repeating it.",
